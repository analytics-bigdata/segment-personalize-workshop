-- Demonstrates how to create a table in Athena that can be used
-- to query event data written to S3 by Segment's S3 destination.
-- This is helpful in exploring training data before being uploaded
-- into Personalize before model building. 
--
-- See https://segment.com/docs/destinations/amazon-s3/
--
-- Note that special handling is required to map JSON field names
-- for Segment traits that contain spaces to Athena-safe 
-- variants. Additional mappings may be required to support your
-- trait naming scheme.
